# Side Audio Bot Customer Service

## What this example is for

`smart-cockpit` proved the framework can drive an in-car voice assistant, but cockpit
tasks are independent of each other (opening a window has nothing to do with navigation).
Customer service is different: **verify → look up → assess → execute** are consecutive
links in one chain, and every step is constrained by a policy document rather than by
physical state.

So this example stresses three things specifically:

1. **Whether policy actually constrains the model** — will it skip identity verification,
   will it invent compensation amounts.
2. **Whether confirmation of irreversible actions can be a mechanism** — the framework has
   an `auth_required` state that the cockpit never needs; this example will be its first
   real consumer.
3. **State consistency across a multi-step flow** — hang up mid-way, call back, can it resume.

## Architecture

Follows the four-process layering of `smart-cockpit`. Only `service` exists today:

```text
service-client ── GCP 6.0 ──► service-gateway ── A2A ──► service-agent
      │                          │                         │
      │ HTTP/SSE                 │ frontend MCP            │ backend MCP
      │ business state           │ verify / orders / stock  │ full tool surface
      ▼                          ▼                         ▼
                         customer-service (service/ in this directory)
                         single business state source and tool execution
```

### One executor, two tool surfaces

This is the core structure of the example, and the answer to "how do frontend and backend
cooperate on the same job":

```text
service/tools/orders/execute.mjs        ← the only implementation
        ├─→ /mcp/frontend   (whitelisted, runs in the foreground)
        └─→ /mcp/backend    (full surface, for composed backend tasks)
```

Both surfaces call the same line of code against the same state. **The frontend surface is
a subset of the backend surface, not a mutually exclusive list** — so a mis-configured
whitelist only costs latency, it does not break functionality.

The frontend whitelist holds verification and read-only lookups only. Write operations
(cancel, return, change address, escalate) live on the backend surface exclusively.

### Confirmation before a write is a data dependency, not a prompt request

The original plan was to give write tools a `user_confirmed` parameter and ask the model
via prompt to "only set true after asking the customer". That does not hold — the model can
set it without asking, and we would only find out in the audit trail, after the money left.

It is now two-phase:

```text
① cancel_order(orderId, reason)
   → returns a preview ("will cancel #W1082334: 1× wireless headphones, ¥899.00 back to
     the CMB credit card…") plus an approval_token
   → does not touch the database

② read the preview to the customer, obtain explicit consent

③ cancel_order(orderId, reason, approval_token)
   → validates the token → actually executes
```

**The model has no "skip approval" option — without a token it cannot execute.**

Three details:

- The token is bound to "action + subject", not a general pass. Otherwise approval to cancel
  order A could cancel order B; partial returns additionally fold the item ids into the
  fingerprint, so approval to return headphones cannot return the mouse.
- The token is single-use, deleted on consumption. Otherwise one approval could be replayed
  into several refunds.
- The amount in the preview is computed by the executor, never by the model — a model that
  gets a refund amount wrong is worse than one that cannot compute it.

**No token is issued when the refund exceeds the ceiling**; it demands escalation instead.
Merely writing "large amount, consider escalating" into the preview would let the model
proceed anyway.

### Policy is split across three places

| Content | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Identity, tone, hard boundaries | `gateway/assistant/retail.md` (six-segment) | Always injected, effective every turn, ~40 lines |
| When to call which tool | MCP `description` / `schema` | A tool explains its own applicability; repeating it in the prompt dilutes the hard constraints |
| Business details (windows, shipping, compensation) | `domains/retail/policy.md` → `knowledge` | Too long to keep resident |

## What runs today

```bash
# Business service (state source + both MCP tool surfaces)
cd examples/customer-service/service
npm install && npm test     # 56: 15 data integrity + 18 service + 23 write/approval
npm start                   # defaults to http://127.0.0.1:3110

# Backend A2A Agent (needs DASHSCOPE_API_KEY)
cd ../agent
npm install && npm test     # 5: full auth_required chain, including the decline path
npm start                   # defaults to http://127.0.0.1:3120
```

Once running you can hit both MCP surfaces directly:

```bash
# Query orders before verification → hard refusal
curl -s -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:3110/mcp/frontend?sessionId=demo' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call",
       "params":{"name":"list_orders","arguments":{}}}'

# Verify identity
curl -s -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:3110/mcp/frontend?sessionId=demo' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call",
       "params":{"name":"verify_identity",
                 "arguments":{"email":"liming3021@example.com"}}}'
```

Other endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Health check |
| `GET /api/service/state?sessionId=demo` | Business state snapshot (for UI projections) |
| `GET /api/service/events?sessionId=demo` | SSE stream of state changes |
| `POST /api/service/reset` | Reset to the initial state (needed for repeated demos) |
| `POST /mcp/frontend` \| `POST /mcp/backend` | The two MCP tool surfaces |

## auth_required: verified end-to-end

The chain has always been wired on the framework's realtime side (6 sites in
`realtime-gateway.mjs`, 2 in `tool-call-handler.mjs`), but the cockpit example never needs
it — opening a sunroof requires no customer approval. So there was no evidence it actually
worked. Now there is:

```text
tool returns needsApproval
  → executor emits TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED with the preview message
  → adapter turns it into InputRequest{kind:'authorization', status:'pending'}
  → respondInput({action:'accept'}) → task resumes → executes with token → order cancelled
```

The decline path is covered too: after `{action:'decline'}` the order stays `pending`.

### Three traps hit while wiring this

| Trap | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| First event is not a Task | `Received statusUpdate before initial 'Message'/'Task' event.` | publish `AgentEvent.task(...)` first |
| Re-publishing Task on resume | `Stream ordering violation: received task in task lifecycle stream.` | only publish when `!requestContext.task` |
| **Losing the approval_token on resume** | the customer gets asked twice — the model cannot see the previous tool result, so it fetches a fresh preview | store the preview text alongside the objective and fold it back in on resume |

The third is a design flaw rather than a test artifact: `runServiceAgent` always starts from
an empty conversation, so a real model equally cannot see the previous tool result. The
preview is the only vehicle that can carry the token back.

## Retail data and scenarios

`domains/retail/db.json` is trimmed from the τ²-bench retail structure: 5 users,
20 orders, 12 product types. The data is not arbitrary — every entry backs a branch
that needs to be demonstrated:

| Fixture | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Chen Jing has no email | Forces the `name + zip` verification branch |
| `#W3301887` totals ¥2899 | Exceeds the ¥2000 refund ceiling → escalate to a human |
| `#W2378156` appliance delivered 22 days ago | Appliance window is 15 days → assessment must refuse |
| `#W5540912` apparel delivered 4 days ago | Apparel window is 30 days → happy path |
| `#W3376900` is furniture | **The policy table deliberately omits furniture** → does the model invent a rule |
| Keyboard has 4 variants, thermostat has an out-of-stock one | Stock check and price difference for exchanges |

`service/test/db-integrity.test.mjs` guards all of this with assertions: references and
totals must be self-consistent, and the order shapes the scenarios need must exist —
lose one and the matching scenario can no longer be demonstrated.

## Known gaps

In priority order:

1. **Gateway composition** (mirroring `smart-cockpit/gateway`) plus verification through a
   real voice session. `auth_required` is currently verified by driving
   `A2ABackendAdapter` directly; it has not yet gone through the realtime voice layer.
2. **Exchanges** (`exchange_items`): needs a stock check and a price-difference step on top
   of the return flow.
4. **Client UI**: customer card, orders, flow progress, active constraints and action log —
   five panels living in `client/src/projections/` as pure functions with unit tests.
5. **Airline domain** (reuse the skeleton, swap in `domains/airline/`).

> The approval mechanism and `auth_required` are two separate layers, neither replaces the
> other: the token guarantees "no approval, no execution"; `auth_required` suspends the
> backend task and carries the question to the customer's ear. Even if the `auth_required`
> chain turns out to be broken, the token layer still holds.

## Relationship to τ²-bench, and one deliberate deviation

The tool list and policy clauses follow the τ²-bench retail domain, but this example
**does not implement its evaluation harness** (simulated users, `pass^k`) — the user here
is a real person.

One τ² policy clause is deliberately not adopted:

```text
You should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call,
you should not respond to the user at the same time.
```

In τ² this exists to keep evaluation decidable, **but in a voice setting it produces
audible silence** — saying nothing while a tool runs makes the customer think the line
dropped. Our persona asks for the opposite: say "let me check that" before calling a tool.

## Policy console

```bash
cd console && npm start          # http://127.0.0.1:4610
```

Turns `policy.md` into `guards.json`, `flows.json` and `frontend-mcp.json` — and
lets an admin change the agent's behaviour without hand-editing any file.

**Extraction runs three times, not once.** Measured: extracting the same policy
three times at temperature 0, the model labels every item `certain`, yet the
ordering rules differ every run — twice producing **opposite orders** from the
same sentence. So the criterion is not the model's self-assessment but the
agreement across runs:

| Agreement | Treatment |
|---|---|
| 3/3, determined every run | Collapsed, no attention needed |
| 3/3 but ambiguous every run | Stably needs a human (policy gaps land here) |
| Same topic, different conclusions | Variants shown side by side to pick from |
| Only some runs produced it | Either a miss or a hallucination |

Five things in the UI; the first four can be edited and applied:

- **Needs your decision** — sorted by how much the runs disagreed. Each grey
  quote carries the policy line number; clicking it scrolls and highlights that
  line on the right. Items that cannot be traced back say so — usually meaning
  the model invented a rule the policy never stated.
  Each candidate offers four verdicts: accept / reject / needs policy / needs
  data, and you can edit a candidate before accepting it. Accepting an ordering
  candidate turns it into a flow rule; accepting a threshold candidate updates
  that threshold. Verdicts live in `review.json`, so reopening the console does
  not mean reviewing everything again.
- **Decision tables** — flattened into grids with the catch-all row shaded.
  Conditions, outcomes and reasons are editable cell by cell; rows can be added,
  removed and reordered, and whole tables created or deleted. Apply, and the
  executor uses the new table on its next call.
- **Flows** — "do A before B" ordering constraints, addable, editable and
  switchable off. They are injected into the backend agent's prompt and take
  effect on its next task. **This is not a workflow engine**: it only sequences
  steps; eligibility, amounts and final outcomes still come from decision tables
  and tools.
- **Tool surfaces** — assignment derived by rules, no model involved, and
  overridable. Overriding shows the consequence: moving `cancel_order` to the
  frontend is flagged red because it bypasses `auth_required`; moving a
  read-only tool to the backend is only amber — it just adds 1–3s of silence.
- **Search and filters** — one keyword filters rules, tables, tools and the
  policy text at once, plus "pending only" and "risky only" toggles.

Edits go into a draft rather than straight to disk. "Preview and apply"
validates first, then shows a field-level diff (what changed, from what to
what), the new tables' data coverage, and how each kind of change takes effect.
Validation failures block the write — deleting a table's catch-all row is caught
here rather than blowing up mid-call on some uncovered input. High-risk changes
such as moving a protected tool need one extra confirmation.

Applying writes four files per domain: `domains/<domain>/guards.json`,
`flows.json`, `review.json` and `gateway/frontend-mcp{,.airline}.json`. Each
write is preceded by a backup under `.runtime-console/backups/<stamp>-<domain>/`
and appends a line to `audit.jsonl`. If a multi-file commit fails partway the
written files are restored, so guards and flows never end up half-updated.

The three kinds of change take effect differently: decision tables on the next
tool call, flows on the next backend task, tool surfaces after restarting that
domain's gateway (the preview spells this out).

The console never takes part in execution — if it dies, calls keep working; you
just cannot change configuration.

## Running the four processes

```bash
cd service && npm start     # :3110  state source + two MCP tool surfaces
cd agent   && npm start     # :3120  backend A2A agent
node gateway/server.mjs     # :18889 foreground gateway
cd console && npm start     # :4610  policy console
```

Five tools are frontend-direct (`verify_identity`, `identity_status`,
`list_orders`, `get_order`, `check_variant`); everything else goes through
`spawn_thinking` to the backend.

## auth_required in a real voice gateway

The chain below was read out of the framework source, not guessed:

| Step | What happens | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Customer asks to cancel → model calls `spawn_thinking` | — |
| 2 | Backend gets a write preview needing approval → task suspends | `service/tools/approval.mjs` |
| 3 | `inputRequest.kind = 'authorization'` → `workState = auth_required` | `server/src/task/task-state.mjs:97` |
| 4 | Gateway wraps it as `<backend_input_request>` for the realtime model | `realtime-gateway.mjs:946` |
| 5 | Model relays the question **out loud** | `frontend-tools.mjs:498` |
| 6 | Customer answers → model calls `respond_agent_input` | `frontend-tools.mjs:29` |

**Steps 5–6 were assumed to need a custom approval UI.** Checking every
`GatewayClientEvent` member showed no "respond to input" type at all — only the
model can answer, by calling a tool. A client therefore cannot build a button
that replies to an `inputRequest` directly; `/api/permissions/:id` belongs to
the separate permission mechanism. The step-6 tool is exposed only while a
request is pending (`hasPendingBackendInput()`).

### Verified through step 4; step 6 not reproduced

Running `runtime/gateway-auth-probe.mjs` with text instead of audio produced one
complete piece of evidence:

```
task.accepted         objective="cancel order #W1082334 … customer confirmed."
task.input.requested  workState=auth_required  inputKind=authorization
```

**The first four steps hold.** Repeated attempts afterwards — including clearing
`.runtime` and restarting all three processes — did not get the model to submit
the task again, so step 6 (`respond_agent_input` actually cancelling the order)
**currently rests on source reading, not on a runtime observation.**

Three confounders found while investigating, all noted in the probe:

- `sessionId` must match the one baked in at gateway startup. See below.
- Conversation history is restored from `.runtime/`
  (`conversation_history.restored` in the log), after which the model considers
  the order already being handled and stops resubmitting.
- **Assistant transcripts are not sent back** — only `role=user`
  `transcript.final` arrives; model speech goes out as `audio.delta`. So what it
  said is invisible; only `task.*` events reveal whether it called a tool.

## Known limitation: sessionId is fixed at process start

`server/src/providers/mcp/frontend-mcp-client.mjs:132` uses the static
`transport.headers` from configuration; the framework does not inject
per-session parameters into MCP requests. So `gateway/server.mjs` bakes
`sessionId` into `CS_FRONTEND_MCP_URL`.

The cockpit does this correctly — its `cockpitId` means "which car", one fixed
value per vehicle. A customer-service `sessionId` means "which call" and should
differ every time. Doing that properly needs framework support for per-session
injection; papering over it with a fake isolation layer in an example would be
worse.

**This is a single-call demo.** Concurrent calls share one service session.

## Policy retrieval

With web access removed, the model needs a correct source or it is left with two
options: interrogate the customer, or invent. `gateway/policy-knowledge.mjs`
splits `domains/<domain>/policy.md` on `##` headings and mounts it as the
framework's knowledge retrieval source.

**The source text is handed to the model verbatim** — no summarisation. Summarising adds
one more chance to distort, and the whole value of this text is that it is the
authoritative original. Each passage carries its provenance:

```
《明远优选零售客服细则》二、退货时限（第 16 行起）

| 类别 | 代码 | 退货窗口 |
| 服饰鞋包 | apparel | 30 天 |
...
```

Line numbers live inside `content` rather than going through the citation
protocol: `normalizeCitation` requires a public URL and returns null without one
(`citation.mjs:21`), while the policy is a local private file.

**One process serves one domain** (`CS_DOMAIN`, default retail). The first
version loaded both; a retail session asking about shipping fees got airline
baggage allowance as its second hit. Mixing domains is not just ranking noise —
a retail agent could answer with airline rules.

### Three-way comparison

The same question — "I'd like to ask about the return policy" — asked three times:

| | Web on | Web off | Policy retrieval on |
|---|---|---|---|
| External citations | 5 (local news site, calligraphy auction) | none | none |
| Concrete day counts | 30 days (from the web) | none | **30 / 7 / 15, correct per category** |
| Wording | "you should check the policy" | "I need to look up the policy" (couldn't) | gives the content directly |

Two follow-ups:

- "How many days for digital products?" → **7 days**, correct
- "How many days for furniture?" → **"furniture is not listed as a category in the policy"**

That last one matters. Previously the executor blocked fabrication by refusing to
supply a number; now **the model itself cannot produce one** — the retrieved text
genuinely has no furniture row.

## Customer service console (client)

```bash
cd client && npm start      # http://127.0.0.1:4620
```

Type as the customer on the left; the three panels on the right show what the
same call left behind on the server: verification state, order data, and an audit
entry for every tool call.

A full run (verify → list orders → ask about a return):

| Panel | Observed |
|---|---|
| Customer | after verification: "verified · 李明 · email" plus address |
| Orders | 5 appear; `#W2378156` lists a keyboard (digital) and a thermostat (appliance), tagged "delivered 2026-08-10, 24 days ago" |
| Audit | `verify_identity` ✓ / `list_orders` ✓, each with a timestamp and surface tag |

**The delivered-days figure is on the card deliberately** — it is an input to the
return-eligibility decision, so having it visible makes it obvious whether the
model's "expired" claim is right.

### Two limitations, both intentional in the framework

**One: the gateway accepts a single client at a time**
(`realtime-gateway.mjs:241`). This console and the gateway's own web UI
(`:18889`) cannot both be open. The page surfaces that error explicitly —
without it everything looks fine (green status light, messages send) and replies
simply never arrive. That cost two minutes of confusion on the first run.

**Two: it must proxy, not connect directly.** Every request uses a same-origin
relative path, and `client/server.mjs` forwards to the gateway and service.
Connecting straight to `:18889` is rejected:

```
WebSocket ws://127.0.0.1:18889/api/realtime → 403
fetch     http://127.0.0.1:18889/api/...    → {"error":"origin not allowed"}
```

The cause is `server/src/core/request-security.mjs` — DNS rebinding protection
requiring the Origin host to equal the request host. A different port can never
satisfy that, and `config.allowedOrigins` does not help (it carries the same host
equality requirement). The framework's own web UI lives at the gateway's `/`, so
it is same-origin by construction.

### One unresolved problem

**The agent's replies show no text in this console.** Tool calls, verification and
order changes all appear on the right in real time — those are server-side facts
and reliable — but the conversation pane only ever shows customer bubbles.

Ruled out: the proxy layer (WebSocket frames and REST requests were both verified
to forward correctly), framework support for assistant transcripts
(`realtime-presentation-runtime.mjs:20-25` listens for six transcript event
types and `web/src/App.jsx:567` consumes them), and model capability
(`textOutput: true`).

Still unexplained: why, on the same gateway, the built-in web UI receives
`role: 'assistant'` messages and this console does not. The only remaining
difference in their `connect` payloads is `inputEnabled` (false from the WebUI,
true from the console).

Use the gateway's own UI to see what the agent says, for now.
