# Side Audio Bot Car

[中文](README_ZH.md) | [English](README.md)

## Agent Presence In The Car

Real cockpit interaction should not feel like issuing commands to a slow menu.
The driver or passenger speaks naturally, the assistant keeps listening, and
vehicle tasks continue without blocking the conversation.

**Side Audio Bot Car** is a smart cockpit example for
`side-audio-bot`. It combines a car UI, realtime speech, a text Agent,
vehicle control, navigation, music, flash-buy workflows, weather, web search,
memory, and custom skills in one runnable demo. The example is intentionally
self-contained today, so the core side-audio-bot runtime remains generic.

## Quick Start

Run the following commands from the `side-audio-bot` repository root.

### 1. Configure Environment

```bash
cp examples/car/.env.example examples/car/.env.local
```

Fill in `examples/car/.env.local`:

```dotenv
VITE_AMAP_KEY=your_amap_js_key
VITE_AMAP_SECRET=your_amap_js_secret
AMAP_MCP_KEY=your_amap_mcp_key

DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_dashscope_api_key
DASHSCOPE_MODEL=qwen3.6-plus
DASHSCOPE_WEB_SEARCH_MODEL=qwen-plus
```

Optional realtime voice overrides are also listed in `.env.example`.

### 2. Start The Agent Server

```bash
npm install --prefix examples/car/server
npm run example:car:server
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:3001`.

### 3. Start The Car UI

Open another terminal:

```bash
npm install --prefix examples/car/react-app
npm run example:car:web
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Architecture

![Side Audio Bot Car architecture](docs/system-architecture.svg)

## Development

```bash
npm run example:car:build
npm run example:car:lint
```

For voice testing on a LAN device, browser microphone permissions usually
require HTTPS or an explicit insecure-origin allowlist. `localhost` works
without extra browser configuration.
